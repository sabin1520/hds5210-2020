# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
49 / 50

Generally, you had all the right ideas. When it came to the work of reading the file off of the internet and comparing against known scores, there's more that could be done there.  Finally, remember to look for patterns in the code you're writing and consider a way to make that code more generic rather than duplicating it.  Nice work!


## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.  They all look great.

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - This is great.  I like how you packed it all into one function.  Sometimes that isn't necessary and isn't the best approach, though.  So, don't overdo it.

Nice work with testing.


## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice and simple since you did all that work up front!

## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Pro-tip: pd.read_csv can take a url directly.  Pandas can read from the Internet directly.  :)

You missed the part of validating your data against the answers.  (-1)
